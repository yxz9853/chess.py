Rules

The main goal of the game is to "checkmate" the opponent. To be able to checkmate the opponent, the player must put the opponent's king in check, and if the opponent has no legal moves then it is checkmate and a win. A check is when the king is attacked by one of opponent's pieces. There are 6 types of pieces in the game. The King can only move 1 square in all 8 directions. The Pawn can move 2 squares forwards on the first move and only 1 square forwards on the others. The Pawn captures when a piece is diagonally infront of it. A Rook moves in straight lines.  A Bishop moves in diagonals. A Queen can move in both straight lines and diagonals. A Knight moves in an 'L' shape. No piece can move through a piece except for the Knight. No piece can take a piece on the same side. No piece can move when it causes the King to be in check. If a side has no legal moves and the king is not in check, then it is a stalemate and a draw. It is also a draw if the same position appears 3 times throughout the entire game. It is also a draw if no captures or pawn moves were made in the last 50 moves by both sides. There are two "special" moves that players can make. The first is castling, castling can be done when the both the king and the rook the player is trying to castle with hasn't moved. A short castle is when the player castles kingside, where the king moves 2 squares to the kingside and the rook moves 2 squares to be besides the king. Long castling is when the player castles queenside, where the king moves 2 squares to the queenside and the rooks moves 3 squared to be besides the king. The king cannot castle out of a check, and cannot castle if there is a piece attacking the squares the king has to travel through. The other 'special' move is 'en passant'. This is when you are able to take an opponents pawn when it has moved 2 squares for the opponents lastest turn and the opponent's pawn is adjacent to one of your pawns.

Moves

Though the program does not allow the dragging of pieces, every move is done through the terminal. The player must enter the specific notations otherwise no pieces will move. The notation for a pawn move is just the square you want it to go to. For example if you wanted to move your pawn to e5, you would just type in 'e5'. If you wanted to capture a piece with a pawn, you would type in the file that it is on, followed by 'x' and the square you want to take. For example, if you wanted to take a piece on e4 with your d pawn, you would type 'dxe4'. For all the other pieces, you would just type the letter of the piece and the square to move to. 
Queen = Q, Rook = R, Bishop = B, Knight = N, King = K.
For example if you wanted to move a Rook to the square a5, you would type Ra5. If 2 of the same pieces can both reach the specified square, you would need to add the file (a-h) or rank (1-8) or the square(a1-h8). 
For castling, 'O-O-O' is for long castle and 'O-O' is for short castling.
For en passant, you would just take the pawn as if it had only moved 1 square.
